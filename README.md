7. You can either right click and click compute, or you can use the bottom at the top menu bar
8. To view results you can click on the Results tab in the Model Builder Window

Python
1. Run dataset.py in order to generate synthetic data. Data is already provided in the folders.
2. Run main.py in order to run the linear regression on the generated data. 
3. A loss graph as well as a list of parameter weights and the error in the console will be produced after the program is run.

MATLAB
1. Run EC552_final_project.m in MATLAB and it will generate the training/testing data in X1/Y1 X2/Y2 and the three boosting algorithm that will allow multiclass classification. 
2. The 3D scatter plot of artificial data and the training and testing error plot will be displayed at the end.
